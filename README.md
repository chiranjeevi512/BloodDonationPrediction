# ü©∏ Blood Donation Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to donate blood in the future based on past donation patterns. It uses supervised machine learning techniques and is part of the PRCP-1011 Data Science project series.

## üìå Project Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyze trends in blood donations
- Understand relationships between time, recency, frequency, and donation behavior
- Visualize distributions and correlations

### Task 2: Build a Predictive Model
- Create a machine learning model to predict whether a donor will give blood in a future time period
- Evaluate the model with appropriate metrics

### Task 3: Model Comparison Report
- Train and compare multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- Present results using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### Task 4: Report on Challenges Faced
- Discuss issues during data analysis or modeling
- Document how those challenges were handled (e.g., class imbalance, small dataset size)

## üìä Dataset Overview

- **Recency**: Months since the last blood donation
- **Frequency**: Total number of donations
- **Monetary**: Total blood donated (in c.c.)
- **Time**: Months since the first donation
- **Target**: Whether the donor gave blood in March 2007 (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
